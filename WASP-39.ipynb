    "## Learning Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will present the data for WASP 39b as observed by TESS. Data presented here will complement those derived from the JWST early release science. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will teach the user how to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Search TESS for data on the WASP-39 system using *Lightkurve*.\n",
    "2. Download a light curve.\n",
    "3. Find the transiting planet via a box least squares periodogram analysis.\n",
    "4. Obtaining a light curve from the TPF and reducing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about the TESS mission in general and the various data products please visit the [TESS Science Support Center](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction: \n",
    "The WASP 39 system is located approximately 698 light-years from the Earth, with late G-type host star which is roughly 90% the mass and radius of our own Sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is host to WASP-39 b, a highly inflated transiting Saturn mass planet which is about 30% percent the mass of Jupiter, and 30% larger. The orbital period of the planet around the host is approximately 4 days. You can learn more about this system and its parameters via the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/overview/WASP%2039).\n",
    "\n",
    "This planet is an interesting as it seems to have three times the amount of water vapor in its atmosphere as detected on Saturn. This object was therefore selected for follow up by JWST.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial requires the [*Lightkurve package*](https://docs.lightkurve.org/index.html), which uses [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting. We will also use [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)."
